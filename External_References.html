    <li><p>Starbucks Coffee -</p><a href="https://www.starbucks.ca/"> I liked that Starbucks is a leading company in
        coffee. This site has a simplistic approach that we enjoyed but the contrast between the large green and white
        blocks is quite jarring.</a></li>
    <li><p>Blenz Coffee -</p><a href="https://www.blenz.com/"> I like that Blenz is a competitor to Starbucks, with
        notable theme differences. Their site is much less jarring but I would like it more if their nav bar was
        accessable after scrolling down the site.</a></li>
    <li><p>The Art We Are Coffee -</p><a href="https://www.theartweare.com/"> I liked their site as a comparison of
        local company design in relation to larger brands. One issue we had with the site was how bright and distracting
        the colour palate is to the eyes.</a></li>
