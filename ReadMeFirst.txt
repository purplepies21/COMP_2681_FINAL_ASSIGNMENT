----Home-Page/Our-Story-Page----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When on 404 Coffee's home page you'll be presented with today's date and a count down 
to international Coffee day on October 1st. Immediately there is the scrolling navigation

clicked and while visitng the home/our-story page, plays an audio object. While visitng 
the Menu or Subscribe pages the logo acts as a home button.

The "Home" button turns into the "Our Story!" button while visitng the home page.

Under the scrolling navigation bar's origin point, is an image carousel of 5 images that 
have opacity styles added.
